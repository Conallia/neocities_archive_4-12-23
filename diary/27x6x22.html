						<h1>27th of June 22</h1>
						<p>time: 19:00</p>
						<p>mood: creative</p>
						<p>So currently I'm on school holidays, and I've been spending most of my days (and nights) coding this and my other website. It's been so fun idk why exactly, I guess I've always wanted to get into coding related things but have always found it too dificult, coding websites has just been so much easier.</p>
						<p>I've also been playing Super Paper Mario, since like 2 days ago. My [REDACTED] just randomly bought it so we started playing it. I actually really like it despite what other people may think. It's super unique which I like and I think the 2D and 3D switching is quite cool and has ispired me to create some sort of world around that idea. My [REDACTED] has also been playing Paper Mario 64. It's pretty fun to watch and strategise throughout the battles.</p>
						<p>When my cat sleeps with me he always decides to sleep right on my neck!?!?! He purs so loudly and he's so happy I don't want to move. Also because he slightly digs his claws into me when I try to move (・_・;).</p>

						<p>I really want to improve my french, it's so bad at the moment, but it's so hard, I need to actualy go to France for it to properly improve ughhhhhhhh.</p>
						<p>anywaysss, signing off---</p>
